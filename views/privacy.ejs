        <h4 class="mv-3 counter" id="par_1">1. Your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with an individual consumer or device (“personal information”).</p>

        <h4 class="mv-3 counter" id="par_2">2. Your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018</h4>
        <p>Section 2 of this Privacy Policy applies solely to visitors, users, customers, and others who reside in the State of California (“consumers”). In addition to the disclosures provided in Sections 1, 3, and 4, we adopt Section 2 of this Privacy Policy to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and other California privacy laws. Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this policy.</p>
        <p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
            <h5 class="mv-3 counter" id="par_2.1">2.1 For purposes of the CCPA, personal information does not include:</h5>   
            <ul class="list-style-on">
                <li>Publicly available information from government records</li>
                <li>De-identified or aggregated consumer information</li>
                <li>Information excluded from the CCPA, like:</li>
                <ul class="list-style-on">
                    <li>health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data;</li>
                    <li>personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="mv-3 counter" id="par_2.2">2.2 Right to Know and Data Portability Rights:</h5>   
            <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request for access, we will disclose to you:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-on">
                <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
                <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
                <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.</li>
                <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
                <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
                <li>If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, a list identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may deny your request for access if we are unable to verify your identity or have reason to believe that the request is fraudulent. We may also deny your request if the personal information is subject to an exemption under Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), or the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA).</p>

            <h5 class="mv-3 counter" id="par_2.3">2.3 Right to Delete:</h5>   
            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete, de-identify, or aggregate (and direct our service providers to do the same) your personal information from our records, unless an exception or exemption applies.</p>
            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the personal information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-on">
                <li>Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by the consumer, or reasonably anticipated within the context of a business's ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the business and the consumer.</li>

                <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
                <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.</li>
                <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the businesses' deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, if the consumer has provided informed consent.</li>
                <li>To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer's relationship with the business.</li>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                <li>Otherwise use the consumer's personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.</li>
                <li>The personal information is subject to an exemption under Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), or the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, we may deny your request to delete if we are unable to verify your identity or have reason to believe that the request is fraudulent.</p>
        
            <h5 class="mv-3 counter" id="par_2.4">2.4 Right to Opt-Out:</h5>  

            <p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. However, we do not and will not sell your personal information. We do not and will not sell the Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</p>

            <h5 class="mv-3 counter" id="par_2.5">2.5 Right to Non-Discrimination:</h5>  

            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-on">
                <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
                <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>

            </ul>

            <h5 class="mv-3 counter" id="par_2.6">2.6 Exercising Right to Know, Data Portability, and Right to Delete:</h5>

            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will provide the responsive information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily useable format that allows you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
